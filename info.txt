Place the train_pong.py file as baselines/deepq/experiments/train_pong.py

Replace all instances of 
from baselines.common.atari_wrappers_deprecated import wrap_dqn
with
from baselines.common.atari_wrappers import wrap_deepmind

Start doing the code walk by looking at the train_pong.py and then digging into the definitions of the functions used there in simple.py

Run enjoy_pong.py which is in the same folder as the train_pong.py to look at the results.
