Place the train_pong.py file as baselines/deepq/experiments/train_pong.py

Replace all instances of 
from baselines.common.atari_wrappers_deprecated import wrap_dqn
with
from baselines.common.atari_wrappers import wrap_deepmind

Start doing the code walk by looking at the train_pong.py and then digging into the definitions of the functions used there in simple.py

Run enjoy_pong.py which is in the same folder as the train_pong.py to look at the results.

My python version is 3.6
I used the install instructions (about two three lines) from openAI page which is what I've also pasted below.
git clone https://github.com/openai/baselines.git
cd baselines
pip install -e .
